# Comparison-between-a-rule-based-algorithm-and-a-metaheuristic-for-building-Instance-Graphs-from-event-logs
My master’s thesis focused on the comparison between a rule-based algorithm and a metaheuristic for the generation of Instance Graphs from event logs.

I’ve included a few Python scripts to showcase the core logic of the project, which was part of a larger university research effort involving multiple contributors.

Using the metaheuristic — an iterative approach — my contribution was to modify the parameter configuration in order to identify the conditions under which it outperformed the existing algorithm (BIG). The goal was to enable its use only in cases where it was advantageous, considering the high computational complexity involved.

Additionally, I fixed several bugs in the existing code and wrote the entire script tabella.py, which was used to perform the analyses described above.
